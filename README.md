# Brahi's Wander-Spell

## Description
**Brahi’s Wander-Spell** is a simple RPG with a linear storyline and fast-paced gameplay designed to keep players engaged and wanting more.

You play as a hero summoned by a goddess from another world, tasked with saving a doomed land. Three tyrants rule in corruption and chaos:

- **Renz, the Corrupted King**
- **Gleih, the Dancing Witch**
- **Eum, the Voidmother**

Defeat monsters to earn gold, purchase weapons and armor to grow stronger, or take a risk by gambling all your gold at the Inn. Every choice shapes your journey as you prepare for the ultimate battles ahead.

Do whatever it takes.  
Face the tyrants.  
Save the world from their wrath.
