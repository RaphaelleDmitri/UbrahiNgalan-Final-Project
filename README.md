# Brahi's Wander-Spell

## Description

**Brahi’s Wander-Spell** is a simple RPG with a linear storyline and fast-paced gameplay designed to keep players engaged and wanting more.

You play as a hero summoned by a goddess named **Tine** from another world, tasked with saving a doomed land. Three tyrants rule in corruption and chaos:

* **Renz, the Corrupted King**
* **Gleih, the Dancing Witch**
* **Eum, the Voidmother**

Defeat monsters to earn gold, purchase weapons and armor to grow stronger, or take a risk by gambling all your gold at the Inn. Every choice shapes your journey as you prepare for the ultimate battles ahead.

Do whatever it takes.
Face the tyrants.
Save the world from their wrath.

## Project Background & Purpose

**Brahi’s Wander-Spell** was created as both a final project and a passion-driven game concept. The goal was to apply core **Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures and Algorithm principles**—such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, data structures, sorting, and event-driven logic, into a complete, playable RPG experience.

This project aims to:

* Show how OOP and DSA principles can be used in programming
* Demonstrate practical use of Java and Swing in game development
* Explore basic RPG mechanics such as combat, progression, and exploration
* Create a concise but engaging narrative experience

Rather than focusing on large open worlds, the game emphasizes **tight pacing, clear progression, and memorable encounters**, making it accessible while still rewarding to play.
